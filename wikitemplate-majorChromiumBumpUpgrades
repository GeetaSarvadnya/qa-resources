As per process, QA runs through the following cases to ensure that the major chromium bump that's about to get merged into `master` doesn't regress the `Nightly` channel. Once the major chromoium bump is merged into `master`, QA will run through a full manual pass on `Windows` & `Android`.

### Startup & Components

- [ ] Verify that Brave is only contacting `*.brave.com` endpoints on first launch using either `Charles Proxy`, `Fiddler`, `Wireshark` or `LittleSnitch` (or a similar application)
  - [ ] Verify that opening a NTP doesn't trigger any outbound connections related to widgets without user interaction
- [ ] Remove the following component folders and ensure that they're being re-downloaded after restarting the browser:
  - [ ] `afalakplffnnnlkncjhbmahjfjhmlkal`: `AutoplayWhitelist.dat`, `ExtensionWhitelist.dat`, `ReferrerWhitelist.json` and `Greaselion.json`
  - [ ] `CertificateRevocation`
  - [ ] `cffkpbalmllkdoenhmdmpbkajipdjfam`: `rs-ABPFilterParserData.dat` & `regional_catalog.json` (AdBlock)
  - [ ] `gccbbckogglekeggclmmekihdgdpdgoe`: (Sponsored New Tab Images)
  - [ ] `jicbkmdloagakknpihibphagfckhjdih`: `speedreader-updater.dat`
  - [ ] `oofiananboodjbbmdelgdommihjbkfag`: HTTPSE
  - [ ] `Safe Browsing`
- [ ] Restart the browser, load `brave://components`, wait for 8 mins and verify that no component shows any errors

**Note:** Always double check `brave://components` to make sure there's no errors/missing version numbers
